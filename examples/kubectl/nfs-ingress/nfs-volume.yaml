# PersistentVolumes don't use namespaces.
# However, nfs runs in a container (with a namespace).
# So, a separate PersistentVolume is necessary to point to
# the nfs ip address in the autostructure-development namespace.
# The Persisten71olumeClaim wont care which volume it connects to,
# as long as the volume satisfies the claim (e.g. does it have the space?)
